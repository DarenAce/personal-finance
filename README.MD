# Personal Finance

This is a client-server application to help efficiently manage home finance: plan your budget, track expenses and incomes.

## Technical Stack

This application builds upon so-called MERN-stack, i.e.:
- NodeJS as a server runtime environment.
- Mongoose over MongoDB as a persistent data storage engine.
- Express as a web-server.
- And React as a client-side JS library.

Client-side interacts with server via GraphQL using Apollo.

Also there was used React Material UI components library.
